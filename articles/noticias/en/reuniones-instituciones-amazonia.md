The Hydrocarbon Research Institute of the Central University of Ecuador made a technical-academic visit to institutions in the Amazon with the purpose of establishing links that generate cooperation for the development of research projects in the region.

The meetings that were held were with the Amazon State University - UEA and the Napo Provincial GAD. During the IIH presentation, they were introduced to the institute's lines of research and the projects it is carrying out, especially the ANZU Monitoring System developed in the Amazon region.

Thanks to this first approach with the provincial environmental authority, we had the opportunity to visit the Yutzupino area, located in Puerto Napo, and verify the negative impact generated by illegal mining on ecosystems.

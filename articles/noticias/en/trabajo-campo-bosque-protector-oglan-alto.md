Researchers from the Institute of Hydrocarbon Research of the Central University of Ecuador and students from FIGEMPA and Biological Sciences visited the Juri Juri Kawsay Amazon Scientific Station, located in the Oglán Alto Protected Forest, in order to initiate activities for the accounting of the CO2 sink capacity in the protective forest.  

During the field visit, plots were mapped and georeferenced to characterize the standing vegetation according to the methodology established by the National Forest Inventory.

IIH researchers together with research professors from FIGEMPA and IKIAM applied to the Great Artisanal Mining Challenge: The Amazon with the proposal called “ANZU” Bioindicator Monitoring System.

The purpose of this proposal is that it will be the first comprehensive system that would allow monitoring of bioindicators in the ecosystems of the Ecuadorian Amazon and that would be in open access so that government institutions improve their regulation and mining control, the different civil society organizations involved in caring for the environment and for other centers to use the information for research purposes.

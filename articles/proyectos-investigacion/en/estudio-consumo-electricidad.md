**Study of the electricity tariff policy for the residential category of Ecuador based on the typologies of households and the inclusion of geographical, economic and technical variables.**

The IIH is developing the project "Study of the electricity tariff policy for the residential category of Ecuador based on the typologies of households and the inclusion of geographical, economic and technical variables". This project was the winner of the 2021 senior contest with US$24,550 in financing.

The objective is to understand the dynamics of electricity consumption patterns of the 4.5 million households in Ecuador based on household typologies, based on the application of complexity methodologies-hierarchical systems with the definition of demographic, biophysical, geographical and socioeconomic, to finally discuss the rate policy at different levels and scales of the residential system of Ecuador.

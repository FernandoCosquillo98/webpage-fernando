The project proposes to analyze the CO<sub>2</sub> capture capacity of the Oglán Alto-Arajuno Protected Forest as a conservation alternative to the ecosystem pressure of oil extraction from the Oglán-Bloque 10 field, under a methodology that connects the flow demand of a process or system produced by the technosphere (oil extraction) and the viability of the ecosystem to supply it based on the sink capacity (Carbon Capture).

It is based on theoretical principles of sustainability and on the understanding of the biophysical limitations of the environment, in addition to the inputs developed under *Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism MuSIASEM*. Carrying out the research project will allow us to know the sink potential for CO<sub>2</sub> capture of the Oglán Alto protective forest, and will also allow us to know the demand and biophysical pressure of oil extraction in eventual scenarios of an increase in the border Oglán Field oil company.
